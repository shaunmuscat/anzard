Once you are logged in you will see a page with three tabs, allowing you to switch between data entry and batch mode, and to also view submitted Cycle IDs. Click on the tabs to switch between them.
* **Data Entry Forms** - this is for users who prefer to enter their records one at a time through the web interface.
* **Batch Uploads** - this is for users who prefer to provide their records in batch mode by uploading a CSV file.
* **Submitted Cycle IDs** - this allows a user to view the Cycle IDs that have been submitted to their approved Clinics by any user in the system.

From any page you also have access to the following:
* **Home** returns you to the home page (which is the data entry forms tab)
* **User Manual** brings you to the online user manual
* **Your Email** clicking on your email address takes you to a page where you can edit your personal details or change your password.
* **Logout** clicking Logout ends your current session. You should always log out when finished your work to ensure your data is secure.
