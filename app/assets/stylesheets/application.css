/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll automatically include all the stylesheets available in this directory
 * and any sub-directories. You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at
 * the top of the compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 * Note: original_rails3_styling is used for legacy styling, as the upgrade to Rails 5 messed up styling.
 *       Additional stylesheets are applied after original_rails3_styling to preserve some modularisation.
